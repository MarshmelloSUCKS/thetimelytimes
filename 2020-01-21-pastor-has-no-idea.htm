            <p>A local pastor has gotten himself into hot water with the Atheist community recently. Tom Tommy, age 46, is a pastor of the Lord Our Savior church in Stillwater, Minnesota. He claims to have gotten harassing comments on his Facebook profile after his Sunday service talking about how Jesus did some magical bullshit.</p>
            <p>"<i>They left comments saying "you don't know what you're talking about" and "this is the most fake shit I've ever heard" on both the Church's page and my own private page</i>," responded pastor Tom. "<i>I genuinely thought these people were sinners. I really did.</i>"</p>
            <p>We reached out to a member of the local Atheist communiy who denies ever participating in these attacks. "<i>Y'all motherfuckers have the wrong guy</i>," the person said.</p>
            <p>We also reached out to one of the commenters to get their take on the situation. "<i>I am not a fan whatsoever of the cult-like activities that happen within the church</i>," the person said. "<i>I have a feeling the world would be better off without religion, and that's why I'm fighting against the bullshit that Christianity teaches.</i>"</p>
            <p>Pastor Tom was also involved in a child molestation case on August 4th, 2019. The charges were dropped because the family believed the pastor had done his job in educating their son about the Christian faith.</p>
